	<b>Lifeline</b> is a complete system with app and website for connecting those people who wish to donate blood and those who are in need of blood!!!<br>
	In this pandemic of Covid-19, there are certain people who wish to help volunteraily by donating blood, plasma and platelets. <br>
	On the other hand, there are poor people who are in need for blood but can't afford to buy blood from Blood Banks...<br>
	<br>
	So, Lifeline is the platform where the gap is been filled.<br>
	The features and flow of Lifeline is as follows: 
	<ul>
		<li>Users can register themselves as donor or as a normal user. If the user selects being donor, they can register as: 
			<ul>
				<li>Blood Donor</li>
				<li>Plasma Donor</li>
				<li>Platelets Donor</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li>Users can then login and search for the requirements. They can search by inputing Blood Type, which type of donor they want and the location.</li>
		<li>Once the user gets the result, they can call the donor, send a text message or can whatsapp him/her for the requirements.</li>
		<li>The donor can then directly connect to the person!</li>
	</ul>
